# Assignment #2 – Handling Data in PL/SQL Blocks

# Question 1 (5 marks)
Brewbean’s wants to include a feature in its application that calculates the total amount
(quantity) of a specified item that can be purchased with a given amount of money. Create a
block with a WHILE loop to increment the item’s cost until the dollar value is met. Test first
with a total spending amount of $100 and product ID 4. Then test with an amount and a product
of your choice. Use initialized variables to provide the total spending amount and product ID.

# Question 2 (5 marks)
The Brewbean’s application contains a page displaying order summary information, including
IDBASKET, SUBTOTAL, SHIPPING, TAX, and TOTAL columns from the BB_BASKET
table. Create a PL/SQL block with scalar variables to retrieve this data and then display it
onscreen. An initialized variable should provide the IDBASKET value. Test the block using the
basket ID 12.

# Question 3 (5 marks)

Brewbean’s calculates shipping cost based on the quantity of items in an order. Assume the
quantity column in the BB_BASKET table contains the total number of items in a basket. A
block is needed to check the quantity provided by an initialized variable and determine the
shipping cost. Display the calculated shipping cost onscreen ( # capture output in screenshot#  
Test using the basket IDs 5 and 12, and apply the shipping rates listed in table below.
_Table: Shipping Charges_

# Question 4 (5 marks)
The Brewbean’s application contains a page displaying order summary information, including
IDBASKET, SUBTOTAL, SHIPPING, TAX, and TOTAL columns from the BB_BASKET
table. Create a PL/SQL block with a record variable to retrieve this data and display it onscreen
( # capture output in screenshot#  ). An initialized variable should provide the IDBASKET valu
Test the block using
the basket ID 12.
